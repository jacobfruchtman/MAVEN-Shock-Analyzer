GitHub can only support 1000 files in one directory. In order to save everyhting here, we move each year into its own directory. If you want to use these files (more precisely, if you want overvmachplotter.pro to be able to read them for aggragation purposes) after downloading them, move everything from the subdirectories into this directory.
