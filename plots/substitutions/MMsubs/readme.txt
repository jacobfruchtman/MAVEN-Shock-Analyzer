These are the plots where the time-averaged magnetic field in the upstream AND downstream measuring interval is a much better characterization of the overall upstream and downstream fields than the fit (and where substituting values therefore allows for more accurate statistical measurements). If the reader considers my choice wrong, fixing things is as easy as changing MM to MG (for keeping fits as is) or MB (for throwing the point out entirely) in savedPoints.txt, then re-running overvmachplotter.pro.....Or just updating values in the csv file: Bdfit and Bufit can be recalculated from MM3+MM0 and MM3-MM0 respectively.
