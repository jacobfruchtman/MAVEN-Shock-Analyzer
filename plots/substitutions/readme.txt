In the cases shown here, the upstream and/or downstream values of B calculated from time-averaging over the measuring interval are so accurate/representative of the overall up/downstream field, and the fit much less so - that the primary author has decided to instruct the aggragation routine to use the former rather than the latter. This is done by prefixing the timestamps in savedpoints.txt with UU for upstream replacement, DD for downstream replacement, and MM for both. To throw the data point away instead, replace the second letter with 'B'. To keep the fit value, replace the second letter with 'G'. 

Personally, I think that looking at the plots herein will demonstrate that the decision to do this was the right one. The fit is after all just a mathematical construct for measuring the shock profile to get values accurate/representative of the overall up/downstream field.
