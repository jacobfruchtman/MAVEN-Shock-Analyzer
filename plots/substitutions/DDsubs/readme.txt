These are the plots where the time-averaged magnetic field in the downstream measuring interval is a much better characterization of the overall  downstream fields than the fit (and where substituting for B_Downstream therefore allows for more accurate statistical measurements). If the reader considers my choice wrong, fixing things is as easy as changing DD to DG (for keeping fits as is) or MB (for throwing the point out entirely) in savedPoints.txt, then re-running overvmachplotter.pro.....Or just updating values in the csv file: Bdfit can be recalculated from MM3+MM0.
