Here's some neat shock profiles that I couldn't include in the paper. 

One of the things my curvefitting routine can do (which I have not discussed in the paper on account of deciding to throw out such points anyway) is identify with >50% accuracy the innermost crossing when MAVEN goes in and out of the shock multiple times. You will see some of those here.
